## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

# Climate Risk Assessment for Yellowtail Kingfish - Statistical Analysis

## Load Required files and setup analysis file

```{r, setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = '/home/ben/Documents/Projects/')
#setwd('/home/ben/Documents/Projects/') # Set working directory to include all required files.
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
library(sf)
library(ggpubr)
library(maps)
library(dplyr)
library(scico)
library(nlme)
library(emmeans)
library(SIBER)
library(distfree.cr)
```

Load data files

```{r}
coordinates = read.csv("kingfish_required-files/Required Files/Global_Coordinates.csv") # Load coordinate point data 
# Load results file for population level analyses for all depths
pop_all_depth_results <- read.csv('kingfish_required-files/Results/mCRS-DeltamCRS RAW/DeltaCRS_mCRS_RAW_depth_together.csv')
# Load results file for species level analyses for all depths
species_results = read.csv('kingfish_required-files/Results/mCRS-DeltamCRS RAW/DeltaCRS_mCRS_RAW_depth_together_SpL.csv')
# Load results file for population level analyses for surface depth
surface_results = read.csv("kingfish_required-files/Results/mCRS-DeltamCRS RAW/DeltaCRS_mCRS_RAW_surface_depth.csv")
```
